 NBA 2015-2016 season was unforgettable. The Golden State Warriors 73-9 made
 history. For the playoffs, OKC ended their journey even though they got 3-0 over GSW
 at first. Following that, the same situation happened to GSW: at the finals, GSW beat CLE by 3-0, but they dramatically lost the following 4 games. 

 This is why NBA is so enchanting.

 Then why this project? We were eager to see how computer, a machine without subjective opinions about NBA and the teams, predicts the result of the game, using purely on data given.  It turns out to be surprisingly good!

+ We published a ShinyApp to give a more interactive way for data visualization:
