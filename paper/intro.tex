\par The Playoffs champion goes to...

NBA 2015-2016 season was unforgettable. The Golden State Warriors 73-9 made history.
For the playoffs, OKC ended their journey even they got 3-0 over GSW at first.
Then the same situation happened again to GSW, at the finals, GSW won over CLE
by 3-0, but they dramatically lose the following 4 games.

This is why NBA is so enchanting. 

Then why this project? Because we want to train our machine on helping us make 
predictions without subjective opinions.
