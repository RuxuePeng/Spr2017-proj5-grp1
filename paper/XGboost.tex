\section{XGboost}

We take the following steps to train and fit XGBoost model to our data: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read in 2015 Regular Season data and 2016 Regular Season data from 
	    www.basketball-reference.com/ as training and test data respectively
	\item Cumulatively add all the data available before the date of each test
	    data point to the test data, and use dynamic moving average of the 
	    history data as test features
	\item Transform the data to the desired form for xgboost model
	\item Select the best parameters (depth, eta) of the XGBoost model through
	    cross validation
	\item Train the XGBoost model using the best parameters to the entire
	    dataset and obtain predictions for this season
\end{enumerate}
