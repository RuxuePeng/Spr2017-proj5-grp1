\section{XGBoost}

We take the following steps to train and fit XGBoost model to our data: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For predicting the champion for the 2017 playoff, we retrained the
	    XGBoost Model, on the 2015 Regular Season, 2016 Playoff, and 2016
	    Regular Season data, with the best parameters (depth, eta) selected 
	    from cross-validation. 
	\item After training the model, we could predict the wining probability
	    for Team A in each game as long as we have the information for that game.
	\item Since we don't know the game performance data before the game, here
	    we take nearest 82 games, deploy dymaic moving average of the 82 historical
        data as test features, plus what we know before each game, like EFF (since
        we know the starters and reserves before game starts), home or away, and
        ELO rating.
\end{enumerate}
