\section{XGBoost}

We take the following steps to train and fit XGBoost model to our data: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For predicting the champion for the 2017 playoff, we retrained the
	    XGBoost Model, on the 2015 Regular Season, 2016 Playoff, and 2016
	    Regular Season data, with the best parameters (depth, eta) selected 
	    from cross-validation. 
	\item After training the model, we could predict the wining probability
	    for Team A in each game as long as we have the information for that game.
	\item Cumulatively add all the data available before the date of each test
	    data point to the test data, and use dynamic moving average of the 
	    history data as test features
	\item Transform the data to the desired form for xgboost model
	\item Select the best parameters (depth, eta) of the XGBoost model through
	    cross validation
	\item Train the XGBoost model using the best parameters to the entire
	    dataset and obtain predictions for this season
\end{enumerate}


In more details, for 2016-2017 season playoffs predictions, we train the XGBoost
model using xxx datasets, and use weighted average of most recent 82 games as 
input of the model (except for features home-away, EFF and ELO).
