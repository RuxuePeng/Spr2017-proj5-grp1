\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

With all the data we have, instead of only using them as features for model 
training, we also designed 3 graphs for NBA fans to explore more. 
One of the graphs is radar chart, which enables us to compare different 
aspects of team performance data for two selected teams. 

Also, we had a NVD3 Line Plot, which can display the line plots for selected
features of two selected teams in some selected period. This graph enables
us to zoom-in and zoom-out based on usersâ€™ interest. 

Moreover, we generated the High-chart, in which there are 16 circles, each one
is for one team, with the color and size representing the historical winning 
rate. We can switch the x and y axis to explore whether our interested features
(say, the 3-Point Shot Percentage, the Assist, the Steals, etc.) are 
significantly contributing to the winning rate.
