XGBoost

We take the following steps to train and fit XGBoost model to our data: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read in 2015 Regular Season data as training data and 2016 Regular Season data as test data
	\item Transform the data to the desired form for xgboost model
	\item Select the best parameters (depth, eta) using cross validaation
	\item Train the XGBoost model using the best parameters to the entire dataset and obtain predictions for this season
\end{enumerate}
